# Dune Turn-Based OOP Game :cactus:	
Dune is a turn-based fighting game inspired by classics like early Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, and Pok√©mon.
Although the primary inspiration for the theme is taken from the Dune books and movies by Frank Herbert, 
the characters and artwork design are a frankenstein from different sources such as Dota 2, Cyberpunk 2077, and more.

This project served as a hands-on way to practice and showcase foundation Object-Oriented Programming concepts, using Scala as the language, 
and a Model-View-Controller (MVC) as the design pattern.
